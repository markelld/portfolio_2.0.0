  "about.description": "I’m a full-stack software engineer with 3+ years of experience building and scaling web applications in fast-paced startup environments. Before transitioning into tech, I worked in hospitality as a bartender, where I developed strong communication skills and a people-first approach that still shapes how I build software today. My journey into engineering began through self-study and continued at General Assembly’s Full-Stack Engineering Immersive, a 12-week, 400+ hour program focused on hands-on development with modern web technologies. Since then, I’ve shipped production features end-to-end using React, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL—building dashboards, integrations, and reusable component systems that improve user experience, data quality, and development velocity."
